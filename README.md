# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Project Overview : 
Welcome to Credit Card Fraud Detection with R. In this project, you will learn how to use R to identify fraudulent credit card transactions with a variety of classification methods and use R to generate synthetic samples to address the common problem of classification bias for highly imbalanced datasetsâ€”the class of interest (fraud) represents less than 1% of the observations. 
Class imbalance can make it difficult to detect the effect independent variables have on fraud, ultimately leading to higher misclassification rates. Fixing the imbalance allows the minority class (fraud) to be better learned by the classifier algorithms.


Project Objectives :
In this project, we accomplished the following: : 

1. Develop, train, and assess classification models using R for decision trees, naive Bayes, and linear discriminant analysis.

2. Create synthetic samples to enhance the functionality of models.


Project Organization : 
The project on detecting credit card fraud using R is broken down into the following steps:

Step 1: Investigate the reasons unbalanced datasets are a challenge for classification algorithms  
Step 2: Explore a dataset with R.
Step 3: Utilize the R caret package to generate random testing and training datasets.
Step 4: Using R and three methods from the smotefamily package, synthetically balance your training dataset.
Step 5: Create predictions for the test dataset after training three classification algorithms (decision tree, naive Bayes, and linear discriminant analysis) using the naturally unbalanced dataset.
Step 6: Utilize R to graphically compare models using the recall, precision, and F measure metrics for classification accuracy.

About Dataset:
In this project, we made use of the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset.The dataset includes credit card transactions performed in September 2013 by European cardholders.The dataset is highly unbalanced
